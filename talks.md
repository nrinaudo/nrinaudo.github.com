# Type classes from the ground up

[Talk](https://nrinaudo.github.io/talk-typeclasses-csv/) that is essentially [this blog post](2015/11/21/tcgu-part-0.html)
in the form of slides.

I initially wrote it for the [Paris Scala User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Scala-User-Group-PSUG/),
but it proved popular enough that I got to give it at [Scala Stockholm](https://www.meetup.com/Scala-Stockholm/)
and [Lille FP](https://www.meetup.com/Lille-FP/).

# Scala best practices I wish someone'd told me about

[Talk](https://nrinaudo.github.io/talk-scala-best-practices/) in which I go through the various unspoken best practices
that experienced Scala developers take for granted and don't bring up, but beginners have to struggle to learn.

There's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByyPqBoV3Vw) of me giving it at the
[Paris Scala User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Scala-User-Group-PSUG/) (French only).
