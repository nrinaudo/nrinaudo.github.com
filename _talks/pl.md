In the past couple of years, I’ve had to implement two (very simple) programming languages for two different companies. I found the experience to be extremely fun, and have thus decided to study the subject a little more in depth - because yes, that is how a reasonable person does it: only after I’m done solving a problem (twice, no less!) will I study how one should actually go about it.

This talk is the result of these studies.
