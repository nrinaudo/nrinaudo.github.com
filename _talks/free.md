`Free` is a subject I've heard or read quite a few explanations about, and never really got it until my good friend Xavier told me _it's merely the defunctionalization of monadic combinators, what's the problem?_.
Weirdly, this actually made it all click for me, and this talk is my way of cementing that understanding.
