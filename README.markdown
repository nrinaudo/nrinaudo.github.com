I find that I never remember something as well as when I've attempted to explain it to somebody else. I am, however, not a terribly good teacher and am quickly running out of people willing to suffer through one of my explanations.

This blog is meant to give me an outlet for when I understood something that I want to remember - and if that doesn't work, I'll at least have the explanation itself to fall back to.
