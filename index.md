# Introduction

I'm not yet entirely sure how this will turn out. The current plan is: I've given a few talks, which a few people have liked enough to complain that the slides weren't understandable without me to explain them. Rather than add lots and lots of text to my slides, or coming up with a way to clone myself to explain them, it's been suggested I write companion articles for them.

The purpose of this site is to host such articles. This might evolve if I find I enjoy writing enough and can muster the motivation to write other things, but for the moment, that's it - articles about my talks. Because I'm *that* full of myself.
