The purpose of this website is to aggregate all of my public work in a single place. It's bound to be a little chaotic, but that's part of the fun.

Most of my public stuff is related to Scala or Functional Programming one way or another, and falls in one of the following categories:
* [public speaking]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks.html)
* [writing]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles.html)
* [project and code snippets]({{ site.baseurl }}/code.html)

The most convenient way to reach me these days is probably [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nicolasrinaudo).
