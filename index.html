        <p>
            
                <p>Heaps are another simple data structure that can easily be implemented as type classes. Just as with <a href="http://nrinaudo.github.io/posts/2014-08-21-purely-functional-sets.html">sets</a>, this first post will explain what a heap is and how to define it, while later ones will show actual implementations.</p>

                <p>Binary search trees are the simplest implementation I know of a Set. This post shows how to write a <code>BinarySearchTree</code> implementation that works with the <a href="2014-08-21-purely-functional-sets.html">previous post</a>’s <code>Set</code> definition.</p>

                <p>I’ve been reading Chris Okasaki’s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00AKE1V04/ref=s9_simh_gw_p351_d3_i1?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=02B6DPVTMCQXB84VAF5F&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=455344027&amp;pf_rd_i=468294">Purely Functional Data Structures</a> and implementing its various structures in Scala, which turns out to be surprisingly good fun.</p>
<p>I feel, however, that the object oriented approach taken by Scala for its collections is a bit constraining, and have been experimenting with a type class based approach instead.</p>

                <p><em>Type classes</em> were an entirely new concept to me when I first discovered them in Scala. Now that (I think) I understand them, however, they completely changed the way I think about code, inheritance and modularity.</p>

                <p>While reading <code>Regex</code>’s <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/docs/library/index.html#scala.util.matching.Regex">documentation</a>, I discovered that it had a legal <code>unapplySeq</code> implementation. This means that it can be used in pattern matching, which I’m not sure is going to be terribly useful but is certainly very cool.</p>

                <p>I was reading up on algorithm complexity and found the following statement: within the context of algorithm complexity, the base of a logarithm is irrelevant.</p>
<p>This was not demonstrated in any way and the reader was obviously expected to accept this as obvious - which is the case, unless your maths are as rusty as mine.</p>

        <h2><a href="./posts/2013-09-08-type-variance.html">Type variance</a></h2>
        <p>
            
                <p>Type variance is a subject that I’ve long found confusing and counter-intuitive. Attempting to use the semi-mystical <code>[+A]</code> or <code>[-A]</code> type annotations would, more often than not, yield an obscure <code>covariant type A occurs in contravariant position in type A...</code> compilation error.</p>
<p>I’ve finally decided to bite the bullet and make sense of it all. This post is what I came up with after hacking at / reading on type variance until I decided I had it as figured out as I was likely to for the time being.</p>

        <p>
            
                <p>One of the properties of pattern matches is that, when not used within a <code>match</code> statement, they define partial functions - which makes them legal arguments to higher-order functions.</p>

        <p>
            
                <p>When implementing abstract methods in Scala, I always use the <code>override</code> modifier. I realised today that it appears not to be compulsory - in fact, decompiling the generated bytecode through <code>javap</code> yields the same result whether or not <code>override</code> was used.</p>
<p>Scala is very rarely that loose with its syntax, so I set out to understand what difference there was between the two declarations, if any.</p>
