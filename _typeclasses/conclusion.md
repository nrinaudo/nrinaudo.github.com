After all this work, I feel we've reached the goal stated in the introduction: I meant for you to understand what type classes are, how they work, and what purpose they serve.

I hope that, at this point, we can agree that type classes are:
* a clever combination of parametric polymorphism and implicit resolution.
* convenient syntactic sugar.
* great at getting the compiler to write code so that you don't have to.

And this should, in theory, be the point where I stop writing.

But when talking about type classes, there's always going to be someone to comment _sure, but Haskell though..._.
