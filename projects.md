# Fetch

[fetch](https://github.com/nrinaudo/fetch) is a client HTTP library that I wrote both as a learning experience and out
of dissatisfaction with existing tools.

It's sort of in a constant state of flux as I learn more about Scala and FP design.



# Tabulate

[tabulate](https://nrinaudo.github.io/tabulate) is a CSV handling library that I end up using *all the time*, CSV being
such an annoyingly omnipresent data exchange format.

It's meant to be RFC compliant but flexible enough to handle all sane variations on the format, and abstracts away most
of the formatting and parsing.

While I still have hundreds of ideas to improve tabulate, it's already fairly stable and usable.
