Having read that whole, fairly large article, you might feel a bit overwhelmed. This is the reader's digest version, the few key points that you should remember.

The most important thing is: if you're working with nested data, optics are likely to be a good way of navigating it in a clear, readable fashion.

You've learned about 2 main types of optics:
* lenses, used to drill down arbitrarily deep in nested product types.
* prisms, used to explore sum types.

These 2 things compose into optionals, allowing you to build deep and complex paths.

Finally, you do not need to worry about the theory behind optics - it's not required to reap most of the benefits they bring. But it *is* beautiful and sort of mind blowing, and if you're into this kind of thing at all, I highly recommend you give it a go.
